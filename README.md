Bag-of-Authors: Identifying the author who wrote a text excerpt.

The challenge proposed is the development of a model capable of predicting the Portuguese authors behind a set of text excerpts composed of either five hundred or a thousand words. Both of this type of excerpts belong to one of the following Portuguese authors: Almada Negreiros, Camilo Castelo Branco, Eça de Queirós, José Rodrigo dos Santos, José Saramago and Luísa
Marques Silva. The developed model should be capable of predicting the correct author with the lowest possible error. This model will be built with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the use of a wide range of well-known classification algorithms.

The report which accompanies the code can be consulted at: https://bit.ly/nlp_project.

# Setup Environment
Before running main_final.py, the user needs to configure a separate conda environment in order to reproduce the results obtained. An environment.yml file is provided in the project repository with this objective. By creating a conda environment through the yml file, the user will be able to run the whole project without issues.

In order to create the environment the user needs to run the following commands in the anaconda prompt: **conda env create -f \<path to environment.yml>**.
